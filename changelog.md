### v2.7.0
---
* **General**
* Tier tokens now uses the minimum ilvl of the item the token will create as their ilvl.
   + This way all ilvl calculations will show more useful numbers.
   + Note: RCLootCouncil cannot track if these items will be Warforged/Titanforged. Only the guaranteed minimum ilvl is used.
* There's now one of each item type included in the test items.
* The class icon can now be replaced with spec icon.
* Filter buttons' text now change color to indicate a filter is active.
* During tests all outputs are now preceeded with "(test)".
* Any chat output during solo tests are now replaced with chat prints.


* **Localization**
+ Armor Token is no longer displayed as "Junk" for non-English clients.
+ Relics are now shown as "'type' Artifact Relic" instead of 'type'.
   + Relic type is now also shown for non-English client.
+ Trinkets are now shown as "Trinket" instead of "Trinket, Miscellaneous" for non-English client.


* **Announcements**
* Added a few more keyword replacements for announcement options.
* It's now possible to edit the announcement string for individual items.
* Have a look at the redesigned "Announcements" tab for the changes.


* **Responses**
* Most response related information is now sent immediately when a session starts instead of after rolling.
   + E.g. the council can now see a candidates gear and ilvl before a candidates responds.
* RCLootCouncil now sends the gear a candidate had equipped during the most recent encounter instead of the gear equipped when rolling.
   + This way candidates can't change their gear to appear to have lower ilvl.
* If enabled, relic responses can now be filtered separately.
* You can now filter responses from candidates that can't use a given item.
* It's now possible to ask a candidate to reroll only on items they can use.


* **Rolls**
* Added a new feature that involves raiders in the roll system, making it seem less "random" and more transparent.
   * There's a new option in the ML's right click menu that starts a roll session.
   * Everyone can then type "/roll", and that roll is then used in the voting frame.
   * Only the first roll counts, so you can't cheat by rolling multiple times.
* This is entirely optional, and the normal roll system still exists.


* **Loot Frame**
* Multiple copies of the same item now stacks together so only one roll is required.
* The loot frame will now trigger immediately when a session starts instead of after ~2 seconds delay.
* Now shows items' type and subType alongside the ilvl.
* The layout is now more consistent in general.
* Added an option to print out responses as they're sent.


###### Bugfixes
+ *Fixed a few localization related bugs for non-english clients.*
+ *A session starting immidiately after doing a /reload could cause an error.*
+ *Fixed a few spelling errors in english locale.*
+ *Fixed an error when the ML receives an integer from whisper during a session with whisper feature enabled*.

###### Dev
* **New**
   + ```:GetItemTypeText()``` for displaying various item types.
   + ```:PrepareLootTable()``` replaces the ```subType``` in the lootTable with the subType in our localization.
   + ```:UpdatePlayersData()``` uses the two new functions ```:UpdatePlayersRelics()``` and ```:UpdatePlayerGears()``` to cache the player's gear/info.
   + ```:SendResponse(target, session, link, ilvl, response, equipLoc, note, subType, isTier, isRelic, sendAvgIlvl)``` sends response to the target.
   + SpecID is now included in the candidate data.
   + New message on ```:BuildMLdb()```.

* **Changed**
   + ~~```:CreateResponse()```~~ is consolidated into ```:SendResponse(...)``` which now creates and sends responses.
   * ```:GetPlayersGear(link, equipLoc, gearsTable)``` adds an arg ```gearsTable```. If specified, use that table to fetch item data instead of from the player's current equipped gears.
   * ```:GetArtifactRelics(link, relicsTable)``` added arg ```relicsTable```. Similar to above.
   * "Miscellaneous" and "Junk" is added to the ```subTypeLookup```.
   * The ```lootTable``` in core is now the same as in votingFrame. Use ```RCLootCouncil:GetLootTable()``` to fetch it, as the votingFrame one will be removed.


*Huge shoutout to __Safetee__ for most of these changes!*

* **Auto pass**
  *    By default, RCLootCouncil now auto passes on items certain classes can't use (e.g. plate for priests)
      and items certain classes shouldn't use (e.g. leather for hunters).

* **Observe mode**
  *    The Master Looter can enable observe mode to let non-council members see the voting frame.

* **Autohide in combat**
  *    If enabled all RCLootCouncil frames will minimize when entering combat.

* **Filtering**
  *    All responses on the voting frame are now filterable.

* **Status text**
  *    Everyone in the group is now added to the voting frame with a status text as their response,
      e.g. "Not installed", "Selecting response" and "Candidate removed"

* **Diff and roll**
  *    Two new columns in the voting frame:
  *    "Diff" - which shows the item lvl difference between a candidates' equipped item and the one in session.
  *    "Roll" which allows the Master Looter to add a random 1 - 100 roll to all candidates should he so desire.

* **Hide Votes**
  *    New option to hide votes until one self have voted.

* **Module support**
  *    All frames are implemented as modules, which can be replaced. This also gives the opportunity
      for anyone to add custom features to the core addon.

* **Disenchant button**
  *    You'll get a "Disenchant" button in the voting frame. Clicking it will show a list of enchanters in your group (if any),
      and clicking a name will award the item to that player with the reason selected for disenchant in "Award Reasons".

* ~~Limits~~
  *    No more 20 item limit per session (not that you're gonna need that), no more "award in this particular order" limit,
      no more "close session when you close the WoW loot frame", etc.

* ~~Rank Frame~~
  *    Old and not really useful. Better alternative in the options menu.

* ~~Raid Chat~~
  *    Noone wants to see people linking items in the raid chat just because someone didn't install an addon. Use whisper for that!

* ~~Pass button~~
  *    Not really removed, but automatically added so you won't have to think about that. Also removed "filter passes" due to the new filtering system.

	*	*Various taint fixes.*
	*	*Alt-clicking items didn't work properly when the player used different loot frame addons.*
	*	*Blizzard doesn't allow to give out loot with a quality less than loot treshhold, work-around by allowing items to get auto looted to the Master Looter.*
